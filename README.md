Inventory Data Retrieval from Verum				
User Story ID	User Story	Acceptance Criteria	Priority	TimeLine
	Develop ECOM Inventory Extraction from Verum. Retrieve F5 device inventory from Verum using filters	"✅ API integration with Verum to fetch inventory data.
✅ Properly filtered list of devices matching given criteria.
✅ Store retrieved inventory in a structured format (e.g., JSON, SQL)."		
				
Data Collection from Devices				
User Story ID	User Story	Acceptance Criteria	Priority	TimeLine
	Implement Tier1 LTM Data Collection Script. Develop a script to extract all VIP configurations from devices.	"✅ Successfully collect and store VIP configuration details.
✅ Ensure the script iterates through all devices in the retrieved inventory."		
				
User Interface & API Integration				
User Story ID	User Story	Acceptance Criteria	Priority	TimeLine
	As a user, I want to interact with the system through a web UI so that I can manage infrastructure tasks.	✅ UI developed using ReactJS ✅ Ability to trigger API calls		
	As a user, I want to authenticate securely using IDAnywhere (OIDC, LDAP) so that my access is validated.	✅ Successful authentication via OIDC ✅ Role-based access control implemented		
	As a user, I want to submit a request for a compliance check so that I can ensure my infrastructure follows PCI and SOC1/SOX standards.	✅ API call triggers compliance check ✅ Results are displayed in UI		
				
Backend (API & Task Execution)

	As a backend service, I need to execute tasks such as deployments and compliance checks via API calls.	✅ Django backend handles task execution ✅ API responses return expected results		
	As a developer, I want to implement an API for retrieving network infrastructure inventory.	✅ API fetches inventory from Verum ✅ Data stored in a structured format		
	As a backend service, I need to integrate with NetCap to retrieve network device configurations.	✅ API calls fetch data ✅ Data processing logic implemented		
				
Database (SQL & NoSQL)				
User Story ID	User Story	Acceptance Criteria	Priority	TimeLine
	As a database administrator, I want to store structured data (tasks, logs, users) in MySQL.	✅ SQL schema implemented ✅ Data retrieval and storage tested		
	As a system, I need to securely retrieve data from databases when requested by the backend.	✅ Data retrieval APIs work correctly ✅ Query performance optimized		
				
Infrastructure (Kubernetes & VSI Hosts)				
User Story ID	User Story	Acceptance Criteria	Priority	TimeLine
	As a DevOps engineer, I want to On-board and deploy the backend API service on Kubernetes (Gaia Kubernetes).	✅ Backend service deployed ✅ Auto-scaling enabled		
	As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins for automated deployment.	✅ Jenkins pipeline configured ✅ Automated deployment works as expected		
				
Compliance & Security				
User Story ID	User Story	Acceptance Criteria	Priority	TimeLine
	As a security team, I want to ensure that authentication and access control follow PCI standards.	✅ Compliance checks executed ✅ Authentication mechanisms validated.
